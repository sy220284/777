     *
     * Display-only, and it has no version to compare itself against: 0.1.2 removed
     * `host.describe`, so the harness does not tell a client what it is. Where a shape used to
     * differ between releases this client read the difference off the wire rather than off a
     * version string, and there is no version-shaped branch in the client at all — see
     * `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`.
     *
     * 0.1.3 moved the baseline for the second time in a row that the older wire cannot follow:
     * session format v2 replaced per-token durable events with one settlement per model attempt,
     * so a client that does not opt into the live assistant stream never sees a reply being
     * written.
