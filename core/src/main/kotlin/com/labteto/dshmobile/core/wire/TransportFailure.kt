/**
 * Why a carrier-level call did not produce an answer.
 *
 * The distinction that matters most is [REFUSED] against [TIMEOUT]: a refused connection means the
 * computer is reachable and nothing is listening on that port — the harness is still bound to
 * loopback, or the port is wrong — while a timeout means the packets were dropped, which is a
 * firewall or a router keeping wireless clients away from wired ones. Those two need opposite
 * instructions, and collapsing them into "could not connect" is what made the failure unactionable.
